"The data backs this up. According to Common Sense Advisory, a consulting "
"firm, 72.4% of global consumers prefer to use their native language when "
"shopping online. And app analytics firm Distimo discovered that localized "
"apps experienced, on average, 128% growth in download volumes after the "
"native language was added—and that was just in the first week. In that same "
"week, the revenue grew a promising 26%. Simply localizing an iPhone app’s "
"keywords can yield a 767% increase in downloads, according to Make App "
"Magazine."
